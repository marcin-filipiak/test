#### **Grade: Dostateczny (Satisfactory)**  

#### **Justification:**  

1. **Completeness (2/5)**  
   The document provides a basic overview of the game mechanics, wind mechanics, and use cases. However, some key elements are missing or unclear. For example:  
   - The term **"n value"** is used multiple times but is never properly explained.  
   - The wind mechanics need further elaboration—how exactly does wind strength impact acceleration?  
   - The game over conditions mention reaching a goal, but no goal is defined.  

2. **Clarity and Structure (3/5)**  
   - The structure is mostly logical and divided into sections. The use of a table for wind angles is a good approach.  
   - However, some sentences are unclear or grammatically incorrect, which makes the document harder to understand. Examples:  
     - *"Speed depends of n value..."* should be *"Speed depends on the n value..."*  
     - *"The Sailing boat is accelerates til..."* should be *"The sailing boat accelerates until..."*  
   - Some sections lack proper transition sentences, making the flow less smooth.  

3. **Technical Accuracy (2/5)**  
   - The document attempts to define realistic sailing mechanics but lacks consistency in terminology and explanation.  
   - The percentages given in the table are a good attempt to define wind influence, but it's unclear how they translate into game physics (e.g., how is acceleration calculated?).  
   - The term **"Between Close Reach & Beam Reach"** is imprecise—should this be a separate sailing term?  

4. **Depth of Description (2/5)**  
   - The document gives only a general idea of the gameplay without going into much depth.  
   - It does not mention:  
     - Whether there is a scoring system or win conditions.  
     - How obstacles behave—do they move? Are they randomly placed?  
     - The exact way in which players interact with the game (keyboard, mouse, gamepad?).  

### **Final Remarks:**  
The document presents a solid **foundation** for the game concept but requires **significant improvements** in detail, clarity, and accuracy. The mechanics need to be explained more thoroughly, especially the **wind system and movement mechanics**. Additionally, grammatical issues should be corrected for better readability.  

To improve the grade, the student should:  
✅ Clearly define **all technical terms** used (e.g., "n value").  
✅ Explain the **exact** impact of wind and movement in a more structured way.  
✅ Fix grammatical errors for clarity.  
✅ Add missing gameplay details, such as **objectives and player interactions**.  

Would you like me to assist the student in making these corrections?
